### Markdown
Markdown is a styling standard that allows writers to quickly change the appearance of text in a way that can be easily converted to HTML, but is easier to read and type beforehand. Markdown is not supported by xarql.com, but there is a sandbox here: [xarql.com/jott/md](https://xarql.com/jott/md)

### Guide
I would write a guide but there are already better ones on the internet. I suggest [this guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
